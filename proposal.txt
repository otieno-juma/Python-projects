Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Grade calculator
2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    My program will allow users to convert the marks to a grade and 
    also print out their average mean score.
3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    This program will help me apply some of the things i have been learning
    more importantly using functions to break my program into smaller tasks

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
    i will use math, datetime
5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes i will use functions.
6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
    yes, I will write a test function.
